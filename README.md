CBA Web UI test 

This is a web automation task for CBA's website.

Pleas note that the version of chrome that this was tested on was Version number - 84.0.4147.89 
Please also note that the webdriver was put inside the project file, however was unable to instantiate.


Takeaways from the task:

I thought the task was very interesting, 
I was trying to get that last bit work where i was trying to validate thte final part of the netbank login. however there was a problem trying to read the title due to that fact that login in page opens in a new page my logic that wrote in the automation script i think can only read wha was on the original tab. I would be very interested in any advice that you would be able to give. 

Thank you again for the challenge 
Kind Regards
